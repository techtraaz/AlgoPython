You are given an array of strings and a character ch.
Sort the strings based on how many times ch appears in each string, in descending order of frequency.
If two strings have the same frequency, maintain their original order (i.e., stable sort).

arr = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "avocado"]
ch = 'a'

["banana", "avocado", "apple", "cherry"]
